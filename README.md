## :grey_question: FAQ

- What versions of .Net Core does it support?
- 6.0.0 +
- I want to extend it to different languages and 3rd party applications
- Of course, if you can even develop middleware/libraries for different languages, we can give you a reference :)
- Why should I use it in my .Net Core applications?
- If you do not want to edit your json document on the application every time and do not want some of your private passwords to appear in pure form, yes, it will not be very useful :)
- Can this version automatically append remote changes?
- Added to the roadmap. I will try to add this in the next version
